      <title>IBM Buys RedHat</title>

      <description>Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s official: IBM is indeed buying RedHat. I&amp;rsquo;m am pro-Open Source and RedHat (and derivative OS such as CentOS) is my favorite but I don&amp;rsquo;t see anything bad from it. Instead, I&amp;rsquo;m very happy that the enterprise world that IBM represents some several decades ago is now taking in RedHat (a huge Open Source advocate AND backer) as it&amp;rsquo;s own.
Whether open source or closed source, any business would need to be in a good financial capacity in order to move forward.</description>

      <title>Liar vs Truthful Mail Server</title>

      <description>Once upon a time, when spam was not yet an &amp;ldquo;in thing&amp;rdquo;, mail servers where all truthful. A mail server that sends an email to another for a non-existing address always receives a notice from its peer that says &amp;ldquo;Sorry buddy, I can&amp;rsquo;t find it in my address list.&amp;rdquo; Years later, the demons(spammers) found out about sending junk mails or spam. So, the IT gods(email admin) brainstormed on how to contain the inbox chaos.</description>

      <title>Redirect Many URL to One URL in Apache</title>

      <guid>/posts/redirect-many-url-to-one-url-in-apache/</guid>
      <description>I recently faced a situation wherein I have to permanently redirect a list of URLs to a single URL. I&amp;rsquo;m used to doing it for 1 to 1 redirects(1 url to another) but this is the first time I did it for a lot of URL.
Example:
 http://www.example.com/oldschool/index.php?i=1 http://www.example.com/oldschool/index.cfm?i=55 http://www.example.com/oldschool/SchoolOfRock.html http://www.example.com/oldschool/School-of-Knocks.htm  will need to be redirected to:
 http://www.example.com/university  The solution? Use the RedirectMatch directive in Apache. It&amp;rsquo;s so easy to use.</description>
